The UK-based university ranking organization Times Higher Education (THE) has announced its World Reputation Rankings 2025. In the ranking that recognizes the world’s most prestigious universities based on votes from distinguished academics worldwide, METU stands as the only Turkish university to be included in the list by placing in the 201-300 band.
The THE Reputation Rankings aim to present a definitive list of the world’s most renowned universities, shaped by the opinions of academics from around the world. Since its launch in 2011, METU has been the only university from our country to be included in the rankings, having previously been listed in 2012, 2013, and 2014.
In compiling the rankings, THE sent surveys to a selected group of academics, asking them to nominate universities they consider to be the best in their field in terms of research and/or teaching.  The evaluation was conducted based on three key indicators: voter counts, pairwise comparison, and voter diversity.
