Announcement about the Services Provided by the Registrar's Office
Dear students,
In addition to the hygiene cautions taken by our university, we aim to minimize the face-to-face communication in the services provided by the Registrar's Office, which has heavy traffic.
In this context, students can apply for a transcript, student certificate, identity card, and second copy diploma online. Although the application procedure is online, the delivery of the identity cards and diplomas is face to face.
In addition to these, YÖKSİS information update can be sent through Registrar's Office web form available on our site and education verification requests can be sent to our unit via e-mail.
Accordingly, we ask you to mostly use the electronic services provided by the Registrar's Office instead of personally coming to the Office. You are welcome to contact us via e-mail and use the Registrar's Office's electronic services.
