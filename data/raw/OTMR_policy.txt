Important message to institutions:
Due to exceptional circumstances linked to COVID19, processing of HRS4R applications might suffer additional delays. Moreover, in the context of extraordinary measures taken
at national level (e.g. universities or other institutions closed), all self-assessment deadlines between 15 March and 30 May can be extended by one or two months, depending
on your needs. You only need to apply for an extension electronically in your dashboard or, if you need more than one month extension, send an email to the functional mailbox:
RTD-CHARTER@ec.europa.eu.
Site Visits: All in house audits planned for April through June (and possibly July and August - depending on how the pandemic situation evolves) are cancelled. HRS4R experts
and/or EC will contact you in due course to arrange additional dates. No site visits dates will be set before the situation both at EU and national level stabilises. Meanwhile, you
can continue using the HR Excellence in research award.
Remote assessments: We will continue processing remote evaluations within the limits of HRS4R experts’ availability and the special circumstances of EC staff being on
mandatory teleworking. Please note that evaluation and communication of outcome might incur further delays.

METU Recruitment Policy embraces open, eﬃcient, transparent, merit-based
recruitment and selection process. The selection process ensures equity, fairness,
ﬂexibility and equal opportunity principles. In order to ensure the involvement of all
parties who trained in the area of OTM-R an action has beed developed: Action 5:
Raising awareness about the Code of Conduct for the Recruitment of Researchers
and OTMR principles
The "Open", "Transparent" and "Merit-based" checkboxes are indicative of the type of policies and practices the questions refer to, as detailed in the C&C.
They are pre-set in the HRS4R E-tool and cannot be changed. No action is needed from institutions in their respect.
The difference between "+/- Yes substantially" and "-/+ Yes partially" ratings is that in the ﬁrst case the volume of the remaining work to be done until
completion is little as compared to the effort that has been put so far in that direction, whereas for "-/+ Yes partially", the remaining work is either the same
in volume or more than what has been achieved.
For the "Suggested indicators" column, whenever the user hovers the mouse in the row dedicated to each question, a small text box will pop up, indicating
options of potential indicators to use. However, each institution should identify own measurements of the effectiveness of its OTM-R policy which should be
further reviewed and adapted.
