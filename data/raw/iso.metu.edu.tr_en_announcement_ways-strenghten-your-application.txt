As the application dates get closer, we have a reminder for all the applicants. First of all, as you probably know, there are different application criteria to apply to the undergraduate programs at METU. These are available
here
.
Although satisfying one of these criteria is sufficient to be eligible to apply, we recommend you to strengthen your application by adding other possible exams for your case. For example,
If you are doing your
A-level
subject and are planning to apply with your A-level results, taking SAT
exam
and attaching it to your application will make your application stronger.
Similarly, if you are going to apply with the SAT-1 test and if you are from
Azerbaijan
, taking the university entrance exam by
TQDK (DIM)
will bring an advantage for you.
By the same token, if you are going to apply with your
Egyptian General Secondary Education Certificate
, consider taking
SAT
or
ACT
exams, or at least one or two
SAT subject tests.
Do not forget that on the online application program, there will be a section where you can upload additional documents other than the primary application criteria. Please contact us for your further questions regarding the application requirements.
