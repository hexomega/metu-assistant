Students of SUNY Programs
METU-SUNY students who will spend their academic year in the partner university should inform the program coordinators before leaving and should clarify the issues related to their registration in order not to face issues with scholarship, military duty, etc.
ENG 105 IELTS preparation course is not offered for SUNY students anymore starting from the 2018-2019 academic year. Students who have enrolled in SUNY programs after 2018-2019 academic year will not register for ENG 105 course. However, SUNY students whom ENG 105 course is graded as U (unsatisfactory) on their transcripts, need to submit their English proficiency reports (IELTS: 6,5, TOEFL IBT: 79 for TEFL, 83 for BAS and GIA) to their OIDB program advisor in order to receive an EX (exempt) grade.
Students who have started SUNY programs after 2012-2013 academic year should receive S or EX grades from this course. Graduation process cannot be completed of students who have a U grade on their transcripts or who did not repeat the course although taken and failed before. Those students need to submit their English proficiency reports to their Program advisors in order to start the process of grade correction/exemption.
