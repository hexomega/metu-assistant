Charter and Code (C&C) and Human Resources Strategies for Researchers (HRS4R)
EURAXESS- Researchers in Motion is a European Commission joint venture that provides
researchers with information and supports services on mobility and career development
opportunities in Europe and contributes to strengthening Europe’s cooperation within itself
and with the world. METU Research Coordination and Support Office has been one of the
first service centres of Turkey within EURAXESS since September, 2015.
An important part of EURAXESS is ‘the Human Resources Strategies for Researchers
(HRS4R)’, which can be considered as one of the important milestones of becoming a
researcher-friendly university. ‘HR Strategy for Researchers’ supports research institutions
and funding organizations in the implementation of the Charter & Code in their policies and
practices.
The implementation of the Charter & Code principles by research institutions render them
more attractive to researchers looking for a new employer or for a host for their research
project.
The European Commission recognizes with the ‘HR Excellence in Research Award’ the
institutions which make progress in aligning their human resources policies to the 40
principles of the Charter & Code, based on a customized action plan/HR strategy.
