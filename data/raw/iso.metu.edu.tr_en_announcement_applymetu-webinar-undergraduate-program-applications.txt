We invite prospective international students, parents, counselors and teachers to participate in our webinar.
The webinar will be held live in English and is scheduled to begin at 14:30 (Türkiye time) on May 31, 2024. Webinar will start with an introduction of the Middle East Technical University in general. We will then briefly cover the faculties and the undergraduate program offerings. After we present the details of the application procedure, we will conclude with a Q&A part.
