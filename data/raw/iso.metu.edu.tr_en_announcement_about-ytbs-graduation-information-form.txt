According to the latest regulations by the Turkish government, international students must fill out the Türkiye Alumni form, prepared by the YTB.  You can only cancel your university registration after you complete that form and deliver it to the International Students Office, via the webform given at the bottom of this page.
Unfortunately, the website has only a Turkish version, but in case you need it, Google Translate works well on the page.
Please wait until your semester status on the student portal is updated as "bachelor of science," "master of science," or "philosophy of doctorate." Once you see this update, then follow the below-listed steps:
