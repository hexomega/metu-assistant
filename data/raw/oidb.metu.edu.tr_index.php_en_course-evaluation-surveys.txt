2025-2026 Academic Year Fall Semester Course Evaluation Surveys
Dear Students,
The Course Evaluation Surveys will be conducted online between 18 December 2025 and 02 January 2026 to support the continuous improvement of our courses and teaching processes. This year, the survey has been updated based on feedback from students and faculty members. In this context, questions regarding participation, course load, learning outcomes, and feedback have been reorganized with a learning-focused approach. Through the open-ended questions, it was aimed to enable students to provide more detailed feedback on the courses they have taken and to express their expectations in greater detail. Additionally, to encourage higher response rates, time will be allocated during class hours for completing the online surveys.
You may access the surveys at
https://oibs2.metu.edu.tr/Student_Course_Evaluation
using your METU account username and password. Once you log in to the system, your courses included in the evaluation will be listed. Please evaluate each course separately.
Although access to the survey is provided with your student ID number, once you complete a course survey and click the "Değerlendir / Evaluate" button, your personal information is automatically deleted by the system, and only your responses are transferred anonymously to the data pool. Therefore, the survey for each course must be completed in a single session.
Participation is voluntary; however, your feedback is extremely valuable to our university, as it has the potential to create opportunities for development and improvement in our teaching and learning processes.
If you have any questions regarding the Course Evaluation Surveys, please contact

Thank you in advance for your contributions.
Best regards,
Registrar's Office
