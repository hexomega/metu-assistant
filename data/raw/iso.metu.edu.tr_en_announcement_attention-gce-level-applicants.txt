Attention to the GCE A-level applicants

Because of the incompatibility between the ODTÜ application calendar and the announcement date of the GCE A-level results, GCE students will be
allowed
to make their applications with their AS-level grades. In order to be eligible to apply, applicants should have at least AAB grades from relevant three subjects on their AS-level. In case you receive an acceptance from ODTÜ based on your AS-level grades, this will be a
conditional
one, which can only be finalized upon the submission of the required A-level grades. Conditionally accepted students will be informed about the further process.
Please make sure that you upload any supporting document you can present, such as your O-level grades, A-level predicted grades given by your school and other exams given throughout the year.
If you have questions, please contact us.
