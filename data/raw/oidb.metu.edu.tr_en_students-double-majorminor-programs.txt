Students of Double Major/Minor Programs
During the admission process of newly admitted students to the Double Major / Minor Programs, the courses that were counted for adaptation, if any, were added to their programs by the Registrar’s Office. Students must register for both of their major and double major/minor programs separately and get approvals from advisors in both departments. Accepted students will contact the coordinators of Double Major / Minor Programs for both the courses they need to take and get registered at Interactive Registrations dates announced on the Academic Calendar (
https://oidb.metu.edu.tr/en/academic-calendar
). If a student takes a course for both majors or major and minor programs, s/he should register for this course separately for each program and get advisor approval for each program separately. They will also follow the same procedure for replacement.
Common compulsory courses of the major and double major/minor programs must be taken in the same semester for both programs. Therefore, the system will not allow dropping a common compulsory course registered in one of the programs for which the registration approval has been obtained. If registration approval is not obtained, the course will be automatically dropped in one program when it is dropped in the other.
Admitted students must enroll in their double major or minor programs each semester. If they do not register, they are dismissed from the double major/minor program by the registrar's office. Students who did not register and do not want to lose their registration rights should notify their requests to the relevant department for permission.
Students who were registered in Double Major or Minor programs in the previous semesters and were accepted to Double Major or Minor programs again must delete their registration from their previous programs (as they cannot enroll in two Minor and two Double Major programs at the same time).
