Welcome to the International Students Office (ISO) at the Middle East Technical University (ODTÜ). ISO is the specifically designed office on campus to provide first-hand assistance to prospective and continuing international students from over 90 different countries.
For Middle East Technical University (ODTÜ), the presence of international students is of utmost importance as they are an essential and valuable part of life at the university. As ODTÜ, we have a rich and long tradition of welcoming international visitors from all around the world as we have over 2000 full-time international students and annually receive thousands of applications to the undergraduate programs offered by our departments.
ISO staff is familiar with and well-experienced in the challenges of living and studying in Türkiye and specifically in Ankara. They provide counseling to thousands of international students both during their application process and after they get enrolled at the university.
Whether you are a prospective student who is willing to become a member of the ODTÜ family or a continuing student of ODTÜ, we encourage you to take a moment and explore the ISO website as it provides comprehensive information on the admission procedure and other practical information that is most common to international students. If you cannot find the answer to your questions on our website, you are always welcome to contact us. Best wishes for a successful and productive year ahead.
