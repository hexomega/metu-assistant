Dear Students,
As of the 2025–2026 Spring Semester, in order to prevent any inconvenience to our students regarding internship applications, scholarship procedures, and KYK payments,
the registration status of all students
will be updated to “
Registered
”
following the announcement of grades.
The registration status of
students who will repeat a year in the Department of Basic English and international students who will study in the Basic English Department for the first time
will be updated to
“Not Registered” if they fail to pay their tuition fees
within the dates specified for them.
Undergraduate and graduate students who have exceeded the maximum duration of education, as well as international students, will not be able to attend the interactive registration,
and their registration status will be updated to
“Not Registered” if they fail to pay their tuition fees
within the specified period.
