Education Verification
In order to carry out the education verification procedures of the graduates of our university, the institution should send their request to
oidb@metu.edu.tr
attaching the following documents.
1. Scanned copy of the diploma including the diploma register number
2. A signed letter that shows the authorization given to the institution by the graduate to conduct the verification process
World Education Services (WES)
Starting from 12.06.2020, the documents required by the
World Education Services (WES)
will be shared electronically instead of the regular post. Our graduates who wish to send their documents to WES should send the below-listed information and documents to
oidb@metu.edu.tr
as an e-mail:
1. Your 7-digit WES reference number
2. Academic Records Request Form that you will download from the WES webpage, fill its Part-A, sign, and scan (If you have graduated from more than one program at METU, you should fill separate forms for each program)
3. If you also want to send a copy of your diploma, you need to send its soft copy. (METU Registrar’s Office does not keep a copy of your diploma, so you need to send it)
4. Your transcript in .pdf format with a QR code on it, which you can apply via program number 92 available here:
https://application.metu.edu.tr/
(If you fail to make the online transcript request, you may still send the documents listed-above and inform us about for which programs you want a transcript. However, we recommend you to give priority to the electronic transcript for minimizing the paper consumption.)
