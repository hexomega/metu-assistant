When applying to undergraduate programs at METU Ankara Campus as an international student, you must meet at least one of the minimum application criteria listed here:
https://iso.metu.edu.tr/en/system/files/odtu_iso_requirements.pdf
The primary application document (exam/diploma) you submit will serve as the main criterion in the evaluation of your application. However, please note that METU receives thousands of applications from highly qualified students around the world, and the number of available seats is limited. Therefore, it is important to distinguish yourself from other applicants.
To this end, we would like to inform prospective students that METU adopts a holistic approach in the admissions process.
What Does a Holistic Evaluation Mean?
A holistic evaluation means that in addition to your primary application document, the additional materials you choose to submit will also be considered. These documents can enrich your application and give us a more comprehensive understanding of your academic background, personal interests, motivation, and potential.
While these additional documents are not mandatory, we strongly encourage you to use the relevant section in the application portal to submit them.
This approach helps us to see beyond test scores and grades, allowing us to evaluate your readiness, passion, and suitability for becoming a student at METU.
What Can Be Submitted as Additional Documents?
Here are examples of documents that can enhance your application:
Language exam scores (TOEFL, IELTS, PTE, or other certifications proving proficiency in any language)
Additional academic exam results (TRYÖS, TQDK, SAT Subject Tests, ACT, national exams, etc.)
Writing sample (an essay submitted for a high school class)
Reference letters (especially from high school teachers in relevant subjects)
Statement of purpose (your motivation for studying at METU and in the chosen major). You do not need to submit your statement of purpose in written format. If you prefer, you can record a video where you introduce yourself and explain your motivation for studying at METU and in your chosen major. You can then upload the video to YouTube (or a similar platform) and share the link with us.
Portfolio (especially for majors like Architecture or Design)
Certificates or documents showing prior interest in the major (e.g., participation in Model UN, online courses, internships)
Proof of community service or civil society engagement
Extracurricular achievements (sports, arts, music, etc.)
Documents related to special circumstances (e.g., disability, illness, financial hardship)
By sharing more about who you are, your experiences, and your goals, you will help us better understand your profile and assess your potential as a future member of the METU international community.
We wish you the best in your application journey!
