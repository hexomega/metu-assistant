Attention to the international A-level applicants:
Due to the incompatibility between the METU application calendar and the announcement date of the 2025 A-level results, students who will use their A-level results in the application will first receive "Admission deferral" status for their applications. Upon the submission of the final A-level scores in August 2025, the evaluation of your application will be finalized.
The important point here is to submit and finalize the online application between June 2-July 9, 2025, even if you do not yet have your final A-level results.
**
Attention to the YKS applicants:
Due to the incompatibility between the METU application calendar and the announcement date of the 2025 YKS placement results, students who will use their YKS results in the application will not apply through the online application program. Once the YKS placement results are out, if you satisfy the minimum scores for METU, you may contact our Office, and we will guide you regarding further procedures.
