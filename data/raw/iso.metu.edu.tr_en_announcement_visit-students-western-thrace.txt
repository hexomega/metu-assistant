More than 100 students from the Turkish minority high schools in Xhanti and Komitini cities of Greece had a visit to our university on the 29
th
of April, 2019. The group had a tour of the METU Ankara campus and then the personnel of the International Students Office made a presentation about the university in general and the admissions through the international student quotas in specific. We thank our registered students from the Western Thrace who organized this visit, notably Mehmet Halil.
