The medium of instruction at METU is English. However, for undergraduate programs,
submitting an English proficiency score is not obligatory for the application
. Still, those who have an English language exam score can submit their document to the Additional Certificates section of the application program so that they can strenghten their application.
Admitted students who do not submit a valid TOEFL, IELTS*** or PTE ACADEMIC score during registration can take ODTÜ English Proficiency Exam. Those who do not satisfy the minimum score from this exam will attend English Preparatory Class at the Department of Basic English for one year.
Students who submit a valid English Proficiency Exam Result (TOEFL, IELTS***, or ODTÜ English Proficiency Exam) during registration will be exempt from English Preparatory Class and will directly start their undergraduate courses.
