The list of the exams and qualifications that can be used as the primary application document for undergraduate programs at METU Ankara Campus and also the minimum scores required for each of these qualifications are
available via this link
.
A score satisfying at least any one of these exams/qualifications is required. The criteria specified in this list represent the minimum application requirements. However, fulfilling these requirements does not guarantee admission. Admission and rejection decisions are made in line with the quotas announced for the program, based on a holistic evaluation of additional data and documents that the applicant submitted. A detailed explanation of how this holistic evaluation works is explained here:

Please note that exam results such as TR-YÖS, SAT, QUDURAT, and TQDK are valid for two years. Documents holding the status of a high-school diploma are valid with any date.
