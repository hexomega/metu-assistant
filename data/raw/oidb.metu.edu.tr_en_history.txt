From the pages of history…
Student grades, which are currently stored in our archives, used to be recorded by hand in hardcover note-books by the course instructors.
Students were required to present revenue stamps as payment for transcripts, student ID cards, and the like.
Student transcripts, which were printed in four copies, used to be cut up by the staff with devices similar to a guillotine.
Students’ Cumulative Grade Point Averages used to be calculated using FACIT calculating machines.
Mechanical typewriters, which are currently exhibited at the METU Science and Technology Museum, were used.
Student transcripts were written line by line and then checked. The original copies were stored in a file and their xerox copies were given to students upon request.
Photos to be used for student ID cards used to be cut and pasted one by one by hand.
